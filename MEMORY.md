# MCCQE project

<!-- SOURCE_RESEARCH_RESUME:START -->
## Current phase

- Current phase: scaled current-Canadian source-packet research.
- Source-packet planning is complete and frozen (`SOURCE_PACKET_PLAN = PASS`).
- Total planned source packets: 1,524.
- Source packets READY: 90.
- Source packets PENDING: 1,434.
- Source packets BLOCKED: 0.
- Source packets INCOMPLETE: 0.
- Total research batches: 159.
- Research batches complete: 10.
- Research batches pending: 149.
- Source documents: 75.
- Generation jobs total: 220.
- Generation jobs SOURCE_READY: 11.
- Generation jobs PENDING: 209.
- Generation jobs BLOCKED: 0.
- Generation queue jobs: 11.
- Worker states: `SRB-114` = INTEGRATED; `SRB-117` = INTEGRATED.
- Canonical checkpoint: current Git HEAD.
- Audited coordinator input commit: `a85b8b6e566a7d6fe05fdd0810d9cb6a2a75183c`.
- Current next action: `PLAN_SOURCE_READY_GENERATION`.

## Frozen layers

- Scope, MCC mapping, ownership, competency-component ownership, discipline routing, question planning, and question-bank targets are complete and frozen.
- Do not reopen a frozen layer unless explicitly authorized or a concrete validator/audit failure requires repair.

## Canonical question-bank target

- Final study-bank target: 6,086 questions.
- MED = 1,086.
- PED = 1,000.
- OBGYN = 1,000.
- SURG = 1,000.
- PSY = 1,000.
- PHELO = 1,000.
- MED exactly equals its effective minimum; do not reduce MED minima merely to restore a 1,000-question MED target.
- The separate 230-question MCCQE simulation is not part of the 6,086-question study bank.

## Blocker and next step

- No upstream blocker remains. Continue research one bounded canonical wave at a time.
- NEXT_STEP = `PLAN_SOURCE_READY_GENERATION`

## Question-generation architecture resume state

This section is maintained by hand and sits outside the generated source-research resume block, which
`scripts/qbank/source_research_checkpoint.py` rewrites from canonical artifacts on every suite run.

- Reviewer calibration (`reports/qgen_reviewer_calibration_v2.json`) is still the first thing to read, and its rule
  still holds: **compare defect counts, not pass rates**. Raw pass rates of 9/10 (Cardiology), 7/15 (baseline),
  1/14 (r2), 8/13 (r3) and 7/15 (r4) are not comparable with one another, and r3 and r4 were reviewed by different
  fresh reviewers, so reviewer variance cannot be excluded either.
- `RATIONALE_FATAL_STANDARD_DEFINED = YES`, in `chapter_staged_generation.validate_calibrated_rationale_assessment`.
  Four fatal criteria; register and expansiveness are enhancement classes that never reject an item.
- Second bounded general repair: IMPLEMENTED as staged schema 1.4 (`STAGE_SEQUENCE_V5`), the
  `SEMANTIC_ITEM_ACCEPTANCE_V2` layer, unchanged by this wave and not redesigned.
- Numeric audit of the single r3 numeric defect: `NUMERIC_ERROR_ROOT_CAUSE = BAD_STRUCTURED_INPUT_UNGROUNDED_SCORE_
  COMPONENT`. The gate recomputed a stated Alvarado score from declared components that summed correctly while one
  component contradicted the stem, because nothing checked the components against the stem. The gate should have
  caught it, so one narrow deterministic repair was made: `_validate_scored_component_grounding` requires every
  component of a `SUM_OF_COMPONENTS` formula to cite grounded stem features and to agree with them, a categorical
  criterion matching feature polarity and a measured criterion stating its threshold comparison. Six regression
  tests; focused 121/0, full suite 853/0. Re-running the tightened gate over the frozen r3 artifact rejects
  `QGEN-GEN3-SURG-I02` and nothing else.
- Competitive contrast seed packs: CREATED and FROZEN. Schema `schemas/competitive-contrast-seed-pack.schema.json`,
  data `research/qgen/generalization/competitive_contrast_seed_pack_r4.json`. 82 candidate seeds across the same 15
  targets, drawn from any Toronto Notes chapter. A fresh independent reviewer approved 62 (43 STRONG, 19
  ACCEPTABLE) and rejected 20, overturning the author on eight. Every target cleared three approved competitors, so
  `FAIL_CLOSED_INSUFFICIENT_COMPETITIVE_SEEDS = 0`. Three sources and 47 claims were added to the evidence packet.
- Controlled retest `cross_discipline_generalization_15_r4`: all 15 targets built, all 15 valid under the production
  gates, including the two targets that recorded `FAIL_CLOSED_NO_VALID_CONTRAST_SET` in r2 and r3. Fresh independent
  verification under the calibrated rubric passed 7/15: PED 3/3, OBGYN 0/3, SURG 1/3, PSY 1/3, PHELO 2/3. The
  verifier reached the keyed answer on all 15.
- `SEED_HYPOTHESIS = PARTIALLY_SUPPORTED`. Supply was the constraint it was claimed to be, and lifting it removed
  every fail-closed outcome and cleared one whole discipline. It did not raise the score, because the binding
  constraint moved rather than lifted. Defects against r3: terminal exclusions 1 to 0, rationale fatal 0 to 0, but
  weak distractors 2 to 5, option cues 2 to 4, factual 0 to 1 and unsupported 0 to 1.
- Four surviving modes, all at selection and realization time rather than acquisition time.
  `LONE_KEY_OPTION_CATEGORY` recurred in SURG, PSY and PHELO even though every seed passed a seed-stage
  semantic-category review, because that review judges one competitor against the target's abstract lead-in
  dimension before the other two options and the stem exist. `SEVERITY_OR_CATEGORY_MISMATCHED_DISTRACTOR` survived
  once per failing item in OBGYN, SURG and PSY, in each case a seed approved as ACCEPTABLE rather than STRONG.
  `STEM_ENACTED_DISTRACTORS` (OBGYN-I03): every wrong practice was named in the stem as something the patient is
  already doing, leaving the key as the only option not pre-enacted. `PROPAGATED_SOURCE_ERROR` (SURG-I01):
  McBurney's point was written as 1.5 to 2 cm, faithfully quoting a unit error in the Canadian source, where the
  accepted figure is 1.5 to 2 inches. Faithful citation is not factual correctness, and no gate checks a quoted
  figure against the anatomy or units it describes.
- `RECOMMENDED_ARCHITECTURE_ACTION = DO_NOT_SCALE`. A factual error reached a candidate-facing stem, an unsupported
  discriminator narrowed a guideline severity band and evidence entailment failed, against success criteria that
  required zero of each. No scaling is warranted while the factual-safety invariant is broken. The secondary
  finding, that the failure locus has moved to option-set selection and realization and clusters by discipline,
  makes discipline-specific generation profiles the next candidate to test, but it was not implemented here and no
  third universal distractor patch was written. Retest items are recorded as reviewed, not repaired; do not repair
  them to raise the score.

## Research-level policy

- MEDIUM is the default for LOW/MODERATE-freshness, diagnosis/recognition, non-jurisdiction-sensitive packets with straightforward Canadian guidance.
- HIGH is used for HIGH-freshness, medications/treatment, screening, immunization, pregnancy, emergency care, legal/jurisdiction-sensitive material, conflicting guidance, uncertain Canadian applicability, or international-fallback adjudication.

## Source-research protection rules

- Previously READY packets are immutable unless a concrete validated defect is found.
- Frozen upstream curriculum, allocation, manifests, and source-plan layers must not change during source research.
- Research one bounded canonical wave at a time.
- Do not generate MCQs until required source packets are READY.

## Resume artifacts

Before continuing, read:

1. `MEMORY.md`
2. `research/scope/question_bank_targets.json`
3. `reports/final_effective_ownership_audit.json`
4. the canonical Medical Imaging allocation-routing artifact
5. the latest final-question-allocation preflight/audit
6. `reports/source_packet_research_progress.json`

Canonical JSON artifacts and validator output override `MEMORY.md` if they conflict.
